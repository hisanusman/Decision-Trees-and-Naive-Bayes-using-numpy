## Decision Trees and Naive Bayes Classifier

### Overview
This repository contains Python implementations of two fundamental machine learning algorithms: Decision Trees and Naive Bayes Classifier. Both algorithms are designed to work with the "PlayTennis" dataset, making them accessible for educational purposes and simple applications.

### Decision Trees
The Decision Trees implementation in this repository offers a clear understanding of how decision trees work, without relying on external libraries like scikit-learn. The DecisionTree class is written using numpy and pandas, providing an intuitive demonstration of how decision trees recursively split data based on the most informative attributes. The code includes methods for entropy calculation, information gain, tree building, and prediction. Users can easily comprehend the inner workings of decision trees and customize the code as needed.

### Naive Bayes Classifier
The Naive Bayes Classifier is another essential machine learning algorithm provided in this repository. The naive_bayes class demonstrates the implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm, specifically tailored for the "PlayTennis" dataset. By leveraging the principles of conditional probability, the classifier predicts whether to play tennis based on user-provided weather conditions. The implementation showcases how to calculate probabilities and make predictions using Bayes' theorem, making it a valuable resource for understanding probabilistic classifiers.

### Usage
Users can clone this repository to explore the code and experiment with both algorithms. The provided implementations serve as educational resources and can be adapted for other datasets or extended with additional features. The repository aims to facilitate learning and understanding of decision trees and naive Bayes classifiers through transparent and well-documented code.
